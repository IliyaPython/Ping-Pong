# Ping-Pong
This is ping pong game.

This game contains interesting gameplay! It has a game mode with a bot.
To work with the game code, modules from Python are required: time, random, pygame.

There are no difficulties in controlling this game. If you want to play with a bot, select the appropriate mode.

To control the left player, press W and S, up and down respectively.

To win the game you need to collect 6 points.

If you have any questions about the game or the code, please contact me. I'm a newbie developer, so I'd love to hear suggestions! :)
